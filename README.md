# C01703-Earblast-Assignment
# Assignment met all the below requirements
For a third-class grade (40%+) you must have:
•	Content marked up in HTML with a linked CSS stylesheet, using a layout and style suitable for a mobile app
•	All pages must use the PHP file format and run on the web server provided
•	App connects to the provided database using PHP and MySQLi 
•	App must contain a functional login page – this should check the user’s username and password against details stored in the database in order to provide access to the rest of the site, and must NOT allow access if the details are incorrect 
•	App must contain a homepage displaying the current special subscription rates (retrieved from the database) 
•	App contains a tracks page listing the tracks available (read from the database using a loop)
•	Demo in lab, able to answer questions on the implementation and design choices (including basic questions on usability and design principles)

For a 2:2 class grade (50%+), you must also have:
•	Use of sessions to ensure that only logged-in users can access content
•	The tracks page displays album artwork (using database queries to retrieve the filenames)
•	Users can play tracks using HTML5 media features
•	Users can browse for music by genre 
•	Provide a personal greeting to users when they log in, based on their username or name retrieved from the database
•	Site checks for likely user errors and provides informative feedback (e.g. form validation on the login page)
•	If the user enters a URL incorrectly, a custom 404 Error page is displayed that fits with the branding of the site
•	Code should be neatly structured, including comments where appropriate

For a 2:1 class grade (60%+), you must also have:
•	A registration page, allowing new users to be added to the database. Users should be able to enter their name, choose a password and select a pricing plan (retrieved from current plans available in the database). Duplicate usernames should not be allowed.
•	Individual track description pages containing more detailed information (you should not create a page for each track, but instead generate content from the database for the track selected)
•	Logged-in users can submit reviews of tracks, which are added to the database
•	Likely errors are handled appropriately throughout the site (e.g. validation of all user input against errors and simple attacks)
•	Passwords should be stored and transmitted securely using a current industry standard (e.g. hashing and salting with a suitably secure algorithm such as bcrypt)
•	The content fits with the design of the page, so that the page still would display suitably on a mobile screen

For a first-class grade (70%+), you must also have:
•	App has playlist functionality, including random generation of tracks
•	Users can browse for music by artist and/or album
•	Album description pages (generated from the database, not created individually) allowing the user to see all tracks on an album together
•	App incorporates text search function or page
•	The review page for a track should calculate the average rating for that track from all users and display it in a helpful format
•	Your code should not produce any bugs when tested by the lab tutor
•	HTML and CSS content should validate without errors (e.g. through https://validator.w3.org)
•	A professional looking prototype app 

For the highest grades (~90%+), as well as all of the above, you should also have:
•	A recommendation system which suggests tracks that the user might like, based on their ratings of other tracks

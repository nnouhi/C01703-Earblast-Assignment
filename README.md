•	All pages must use the PHP file format and run on the web server provided <br />
•	App connects to the provided database using PHP and MySQLi <br />
•	App must contain a functional login page – this should check the user’s username and password against details stored in the database in order to provide access to the rest of the site, and must NOT allow access if the details are incorrect <br />
•	App must contain a homepage displaying the current special subscription rates (retrieved from the database) <br />
•	App contains a tracks page listing the tracks available (read from the database using a loop)<br />
•	Demo in lab, able to answer questions on the implementation and design choices (including basic questions on usability and design principles)<br />

# For a 2:2 class grade (50%+), you must also have: <br />
•	Use of sessions to ensure that only logged-in users can access content <br />
•	The tracks page displays album artwork (using database queries to retrieve the filenames) <br />

•	Users can browse for music by genre <br />
•	Provide a personal greeting to users when they log in, based on their username or name retrieved from the database <br />
